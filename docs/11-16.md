## A Word About the Bivariate (Many)
In the plot_many_versus_expected_bivariate() function, I changed the join from left to outer.
This was done to penalize the extraneous organisms annotated by the pipelines.

- Questions:
	- What should the threshold be?
	- Could simulate across several orders of magnitude to find out.
	- Should the expected and observed be joined left on the expected (for
	  a plot of only how well it does for the expected values?) outer to
	  take into account the extraneous values?
