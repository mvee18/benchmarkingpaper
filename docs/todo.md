# TODO

## 1/4/23

- I think that the unclassified is not being accounted for the WGSA in the figures.ipynb? 
- I am accounting for it in the plot_pipelines.

### Problems
- TODO: Both WGSA and JAMS give an unclassfied RA. I need to go back to the gathering functions and make sure it grabs this amount.

- The amount of fixing is going to be annoying.
