# Notes 1-26
- Changing the minimum for uniform filling from all using expected_min / 10 to expected_min / 10 and obs_min / 10 only very minimally changed the results.
    - May mean that the AD is less affected by the small perturbation, but rather by the total number of wrong species. We can see this with filtering improving diversity, which also moves the AD downward.
    - Would it be interesting to do the left join and see the difference? (We did left join at first.)
    - Is this the best replacmement method (imputation on such sparse data is very difficult.)

- May want to change the pipeline plotting notebook (utils/paper) to use the outer join for the calculation of stats and only use values greater than zero on the expected side.
    - Renormalize after filtering?
