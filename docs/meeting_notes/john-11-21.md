# Meeting With John
- The R^2, MAE, RMSE, and BC were calculated on the linear (i.e., non transformed data).
- All these values are left-joined, which means we are considering only the
  taxa present in the expected communities.
	- Not penalized for giving "too much data" YET, but there is a paper
	  which considered this issue and gave useful metrics 
- The CLR data was adjusted for 0s by the mutiplicative replacement method,
  with a delta of the smallest value in the expected, divided by 10. 
  	- This is an ongoing problem.
