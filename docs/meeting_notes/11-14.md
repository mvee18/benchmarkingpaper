# Notes For 11-14.
## Updates to Tourlousse Data Set
Since the Tourlousse data set presents strain level data, the organisms with
subsp. are being collapsed into their parent species. This is because the
pipelines are currently not gathering strain level data, rather the species
level data. In such a case, no pipeline would ever find those organisms.
