# Notes
## Bmock12
The DSM tag was removed from the three species to allow for annotation since these strains have not been given TAXIDs.

## CamiSimGI
Anything at 0 relative abundance was removed. I believe this is from using percentages to two decimals, which means that anything below that is missed. I cannot fix this without the count data.
